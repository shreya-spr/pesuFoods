// to create Index - do it inside mongoDB compass shell
db.foodItems.createIndex({name:"text", price:"text"})


Goal for the Admin part:
- Login and logout functionality
- In the dashboard, the admin must be able to see :
    - the order deets placed by the customers 
        - so once the user clicks on checkout, the details must get added to 'orders' doc
    - Must be able to update status of order to "Done" once the food is served




    - When user adds items to the cart and proceeds to checkout (clicks on Checkout button), then: add that data to the 'orders' collection in database. Include the canteen name say, parkingLot
    - Then when you log in as an admin: In your dashboard just do GET request to show all pending orders. 
    - Add an option to mark it as done, that would then delete it from the database.
